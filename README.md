# Mini Page Builder

This project was authored by Rahul Sharma.

## Instructions to run the code locally:

This project was built using Node v14.21.3 and React v18.2.0. Try to fulfill these technical requirements before running the app, although a few versions down/up also wont hurt. 

After cloning the project,
* Navigate to the project directory
* Run `npm i` or `npm install`
* Run `npm run start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## How the project works?

This project is a basic example of a page builder, in which user has the option to build a page's layout using three types of blocks - **Label**, **Input** and **Text**. Here is a basic example of how to do the same: 

* Click and hold a block from the sidebar named **Blocks**
* Drag it over to the blank drop area and drop it wherever you want to place it.
* Upon dropping, a modal will pop up asking for basic configuration details of the block. Fill those correctly.
* Click on **Save Changes**. You will then see the block placed on the blank area.
* All blocks can be moved around in the blank area.
* To edit a block after placing it, click on it once and press Enter. Then fill the details in the modal that pops up and click Save Changes.
* To delete a block, click on it once and press Delete/Backspace. This will remove it from the area. 
* Whatever you place in the blank area will remain there despite page refresh or browser tab close.
